    "longDescription": "Developed a predictive model for diabetes progression using real-world medical datasets. Implemented regression techniques to estimate disease progression over time based on health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The project explores data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Visualization tools highlight trends and provide interpretability for healthcare insights.",
